Welcome to Django Records!

This is a site I built using a Django template to learn Django. My objective is to add things to the site and improve and rebuild as I learn more about the Django framwework.

The objective was to build a database that took in a number of details in one entry. Initally sorted by ID, I'm working to sort by each detail, and adding at least one more detail, genre, to be able to group entries further horizontally, and then replicate that alphabetically to group items vertically.

Further along there will be more graphics that hopefully include album art with each entry as well.
